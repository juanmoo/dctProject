\begin{abstract}
  This is an example SIAM \LaTeX article. This can be used as a
  template for new articles.  Abstracts must be able to stand alone
  and so cannot contain citations to the paper's references,
  equations, etc.  An abstract must consist of a single paragraph and
  be concise. Because of online formatting, abstracts must appear as
  plain as possible. Any equations should be inline.
